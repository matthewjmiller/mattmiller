> We can understand a good deal about reading by considering not what our eyes do but rather how our hands are occupied. The reader who uses her hands only to turn pages is engaged in a significantly different activity than the one who holds; a pencil; and _that_ reader does something subtly (but significantly) different than the one who holds a highlighter.
