To face the unspoken unguarded thoughts of habitual hearts     
A vanguard of electricians a village full of tarts     
Who say you must protest, you must protest     
It is your diamond duty . . .     
Ah, but in such an ugly time the true protest is beauty.

Phil Ochs, quoted by [Matt Milliner](http://www.booksandculture.com/site/utilities/print.html?id=98990)
