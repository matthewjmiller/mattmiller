![Darkened cities by Thierry Cohen](https://github.com/matthewjmiller/mattmiller/blob/gh-pages/_assets/thierry-cohen.jpg?raw=true)

From the series *Darkened Cities* by Thierry Cohen, imagining the skies we could see in urban areas if we turned off all the lights.

[staceythinx](http://staceythinx.tumblr.com/post/38406052886/darkened-cities-by-thierry-cohen-imagines-the) has a bunch of interesting process information and adds this:

> Cohen hasn’t simply shown us the skies that we’re missing. His cities look dead under the fireworks display above No lights in the windows, no tracers of traffic. They are (in fact) photographed in daylight, when lights shine out less brightly. In urban mythology the city teems with energy and illumines everything around it. Cohen’s pictures are crafted to say the opposite. These are cold cities, cut off from the seemingly infinite energies above.
