> When rich people present the idea that they’ve learned to live lightly as a paradoxical insight, they have the idea of wealth backwards. You can only have that kind of lightness *through* wealth.
> 
> If you buy food in bulk, you need a big fridge. If you can’t afford to replace all the appliances in your house, you need several junk drawers. If you can’t afford car repairs, you might need a half-gutted second car of a similar model up on blocks, where certain people will make fun of it and call you trailer trash.
> 
> Please, if you are rich, stop explaining the idea of freedom from stuff as if it’s a trick that *even you* have somehow mastered.
> 
> The *only way* to own very little and be safe is to be rich.
