"Day-in, day-out, Calvin keeps running into evidence that the world isn’t built to his (and our) specifications. All humor is, in one way or another, about our resistance to that evidence." [Calvin & Hobbes: America’s Most Profound Comic Strip"](http://www.wsj.com/articles/calvin-and-hobbes-americas-most-profound-comic-strip-1425656199).

I think it’s worth considering the thesis that not just all humor, but much good literature, is about our resistance to the knowledge that the world isn’t built to suit us.
