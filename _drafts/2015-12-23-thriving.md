"The Christian communities that thrive will
* be radically Christ-centered always;
* refuse to be therapeutic, but rather emphasize the worship we *owe* to the God who made and redeemed us;
* connect imaginatively and substantively with Christians throughout the past and around the world;
* be open to all, but reserve leadership to those who are willing to commit to radical obedience;
* turn the other cheek and go cheerfully on when attacked by the world; **and**
* recognize these practices in other communities, even those outside their tradition."
