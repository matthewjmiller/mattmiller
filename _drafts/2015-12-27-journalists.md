"Journalists and advertising men make a good team, since the one group keeps us abreast of the worldâ€™s miseries, and the other keeps us agog with promises of extreme comfort, the two combining to provide a crude, secular analogue of the distinction between Christus Crucifixus and Christus Triumphans." - Kenneth Burke, *Permanence and Change.*
