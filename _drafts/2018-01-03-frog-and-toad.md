> Toad is painfully aware that Frog is more accomplished than he is, and it eats away at him, at least subconsciously. In his dream (which should be required reading for every adolescent and adult), he finally triumphs over Frog so entirely that Frog disappears altogether, and Toad realizes that being second-best is not nearly as bad as being alone. He wants Frog to be “his own right size,” even if that’s bigger than Toad.

[Simcha Fisher on the Frog and Toad series, a beautiful portrayal of friendship](https://www.simchafisher.com/2017/06/19/frog-and-toad-are-their-own-right-size/). I love reading these books: they have beautiful, pure and simple diction. Probably their most commonly used word: "together."
