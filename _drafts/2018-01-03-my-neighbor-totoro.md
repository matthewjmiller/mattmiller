> *My Neighbor Totoro* is a genuine children’s film, attuned to child psychology. Satsuki and Mei move and speak like children: they run and romp, giggle and yell. The sibling dynamic is sensitively rendered: Satsuki is eager to impress her parents but sometimes succumbs to silliness, while Mei is Satsuki’s shadow and echo (with an independent streak). But perhaps most uniquely, *My Neighbor Totoro* follows children’s goals and concerns. Its protagonists aren’t given a mission or a call to adventure—in the absence of a larger drama, they create their own, as children in stable environments do. They play.

[Lauren Wilford on *My Neighbor Totoro* as true children's cinema](http://www.brightwalldarkroom.com/2017/03/13/towards-a-true-childrens-cinema-on-my-neighbor-totoro/). This is a great piece full of excellent observations about children, boredom, realism, and beauty. We don't let our kids watch many movies, but *My Neighbor Totoro* is one we do—and it totally enthralls them.
