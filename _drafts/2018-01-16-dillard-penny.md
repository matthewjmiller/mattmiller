> If you cultivate a healthy poverty and simplicity, so that finding a penny will literally make your day, then, since the world is in fact planted in pennies, you have with your poverty bought a lifetime of days.

Annie Dillard, *Pilgrim at Tinker Creek*

I have carried this thought with me constantly since I read it in high school. I still pick up pennies.
