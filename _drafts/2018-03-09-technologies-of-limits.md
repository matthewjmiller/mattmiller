> Our great need now is for sciences and technologies of limits, of domesticity, of what Wes Jackson of the Land Institute in Salina, Kansas, has called “homecoming.” These would be specifically human sciences and technologies, working, as the best humans always have worked, within self-imposed limits. The limits would be the accepted contexts of places, communities, and neighborhoods, both natural and human.

[Wendell Berry](https://harpers.org/archive/2008/05/faustian-economics/)

I'm reading a lot of Berry right now and thinking through his work; rest assured I don't intend this blog to become a Wendell Berry fan site, but his presence is likely to be steady for a little while here.
