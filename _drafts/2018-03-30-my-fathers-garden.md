> On the outskirts, in a waste of clay and rock
>
> unearthed when the Interstate went through,
> 
> he made his gardenâ€”leveled and cleared
>
> the gutted soil. Then in early spring
> 
> he brought sacks of sphagnum and guano,
>
> water in gallon jugs, since the spring rains
>
> were never enough, and small bags of seed
>
> with odd names: Early Girl and Black Magic;
>
> Big Max, Straight Eight and Kentucky Wonder.
> 
> Testing, holding fast to that which was good.
