Sometimes, on waking, she would close her eyes    
For a last look at that white house she knew    
In sleep alone, and held no title to,    
And had not entered yet, for all her sighs.

What did she tell me of that house of hers?    
White gatepost; terrace; fanlight of the door;    
A widowâ€™s walk above the bouldered shore;    
Salt winds that ruffle the surrounding firs.

Is she now there, wherever there may be?    
Only a foolish man would hope to find    
That haven fashioned by her dreaming mind.    
Night after night, my love, I put to sea.
