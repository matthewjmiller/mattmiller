> Yet trees are not ‘trees’, until so named and seen   
and never were so named, till those had been    
who speech’s involuted breath unfurled,    
faint echo and dim picture of the world,    
but neither record nor a photograph,    
being divination, judgement, and a laugh    
response of those that felt astir within    
by deep monition movements that were kin    
to life and death of trees, of beasts, of stars:    
free captives undermining shadowy bars,    
digging the foreknown from experience    
and panning the vein of spirit out of sense.    
Great powers they slowly brought out of themselves    
and looking backward they beheld the elves    
that wrought on cunning forges in the mind,    
and light and dark on secret looms entwined.    
He sees no stars who does not see them first    
of living silver made that sudden burst    
to flame like flowers beneath an ancient song,    
whose very echo after-music long    
has since pursued. There is no firmament,    
only a void, unless a jewelled tent    
myth-woven and elf-patterned; and no earth,    
unless the mother’s womb whence all have birth.    
The heart of Man is not compound of lies,    
but draws some wisdom from the only Wise,    
and still recalls him.

Tolkien, Mythopoeia
