> We tear apart what God has joined together only at grave peril to ourselves: By dividing sex from procreation, we reconfigure the form which God has laid down for us to understand the nature of his agency in bringing new life into the world. If a people who emphasize the gospel cannot say no to that division, we are a people unworthy of our name.

[Matt Lee Anderson and Andrew Walker against IVF](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/evangelicalisms-silence-ivf/). IVF, like many other matters, has been largely ignored by evangelicals as the serious matter of theological ethics that it is. We so often overlook these questions or give them only the most facile treatment, and are accordingly put to shame by the work of other traditions. I am so grateful to Matt Anderson, in particular, for his steadfast work challenging evangelicals to consider a richer and more reflective theological ethic.
