> The refusal of interpretation is itself a mode of interpretation

A sharp observation from [Megan O'Gieblyn in an excellent, searching piece about AI, the Book of Job, and the search for answers](https://believermag.com/good-shepherds/): saying "we can't answer that question" is, in fact, a way to answer the question. Worth noting, of course, that though O'Gieblyn interrogates and rejects the hermeneutics of mystery reflected in the Calvinism of her upbringing as well as the defense of AI, she ends the essay endorsing another one, a kind of open theism. I believe she does so purposefully, which just illustrates that at some point everybody gets to the bounds of their own hermeneutic.
