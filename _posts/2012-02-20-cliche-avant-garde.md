> Why is it that people defending purportedly innovative art always seem to fall back on the most shopworn cliches and the hokiest Romantic-hero narratives to do so?

[Laura Miller in defense of fact checking](http://www.salon.com/2012/02/09/in_defense_of_fact_checking/singleton/).

Excellent question, *a propo* the lyric essayist John D'Agata’s refusal to be edited. I can understand the perspective that says the essayist is an artist too, and thus should be free to pursue art rather than pure reportage. But (as a wannabe essayist myself), I’m convinced enough of the aesthetic qualities of *the real* to want to privilege them above my own essayistic constructions. Stranger than fiction, they say. On this, I’m with Laura Miller, who insists that fact-checking isn’t so much necessary as it is *good for you.*
