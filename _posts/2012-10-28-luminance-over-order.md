> We settled for that, then–for luminance over order, for terse beauty and a smeared-lipstick brand of soul, for spot-welding over handicraft; for leaving ‘the edges wild,’ as Linford’s father had once so richly advised him, and for never comparing this particular journey to any other.

Joe Henry, in the liner notes to Over the Rhine's album *The Long Surrender*

Allow me to suggest this comment on producing an album as a decent philosophy of life.
