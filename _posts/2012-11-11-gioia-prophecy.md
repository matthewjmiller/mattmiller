> O Lord of indirection and ellipses,    
ignore our prayers. Deliver us from distraction.    
Slow our heartbeat to a cricket’s call.    
>
> In the green torpor of the afternoon,    
bless us with ennui and quietude.    
And grant us only what we fear, so that    
> 
> Underneath the murmur of the wasp    
we hear the dry grass bending in the wind    
and the spider’s silken whisper from its web.
