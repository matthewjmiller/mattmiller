An object or a meal has different meaning and significance if we know it to be the product of a human being working skilfully with tools rather than a machine stamping out another clone. Even if in some ways a mass-produced object is superior in its physical properties, we have good reasons for preferring a less perfect, handcrafted one.

We are knowing as well as sensing creatures, and knowing where things come from, and how their makers are treated, does and should affect how we feel about them. Chocolate made from cocoa beans grown by people in near slave conditions should taste more bitter than a fairly traded bar, even if it does not in a blind tasting. Blindness, far from making tests fair, actually robs us of knowledge of what is most important, while perpetuating the illusion that all that really matters is how it feels or seems at the moment of consumption.

SO MUCH AWESOME in [this piece by Julian Baggini](http://www.aeonmagazine.com/being-human/julian-baggini-coffee-artisans/) (via @mattthomas).

Let me count the ways:

* Coffee, obviously.
* A productive and nuanced messing with the Enlightenment rationality implied by blind taste-testing.
* A thoughtful discussion of the human, the mechanical, and the reasons for our preferences.
* Some implications for our discussion of organic and industrial agriculture.
