[Jeffrey Overstreet on Wes Anderson's *Moonrise Kingdom*](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/lookingcloser/2012/07/moonrise-kingdom-2012/), a film I love:

> For all of their insights, the children need the community that assembles in the “ark” of that storm-battered church. They need loving fathers and mothers, so they aren’t swept away. What will the grownups hold on to, to keep from falling?

> An answer is suggested in the film’s climactic image—bold as a woodcut, resonant as a hallelujah chorus. It left me thunderstruck.

I don’t know if Overstreet or Anderson is aware, but it was a very prominent medieval trope to see Noah’s Ark as a typological figure of the church–the church is a refuge for sinners just as the Ark was a refuge. I loved seeing (through Overstreet’s deft parallel) that medieval typology mirrored in Anderson’s ‘60’s-tinted world.
