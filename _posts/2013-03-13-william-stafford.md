He is walking across a field of wheat    
in Kansas, grain as tall as his shoulder    
and as tan as his face. He is cupping his hands    
to his mouth, shouting words the wind steals    
and throws into the air like chaff. I need to know    
what he’s said and begin chasing his voice    
as it scuttles across the ground like a sheaf of newsprint.    
He, too, is running, but on a slender path in Oregon    
cut by the hooves of ungulates. For someone    
who’s been dead nearly twenty years, he is remarkably fit,    
and I can’t catch him until he stops at the bottom of the hill    
where a stream washes on toward a bay. He says    
the sea knows mistakes he has made. He says    
the tides have told the world about them.    
He points to the sky, and my eye follows    
into the tops of these finely needled trees    
where darkness and light marry. He asks    
for a glass of water, and I realize he is laid out    
on our couch downstairs, head propped on a pillow,    
left arm bending like a basket to cradle his thick    
mat of hair. The lamp on the end table sheds a circle    
of light, and he muses about what is hidden    
between the pinecone’s creased tongues. I stumble    
over the Latin for lodgepole, *Pinus contorta*,    
and tell him this seed must have fire    
to release its seed. He is writing on a legal pad    
in his barely legible scrawl. I make out the words    
*let* and *fire* and *come.*
