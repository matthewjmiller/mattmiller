> How blest art thou, canst love the country, Wroth,     
> Whether by choice, or fate, or both;     
> And, though so near the city and the court,     
> Art ta'en with neither’s vice nor sport;     
> That, at great times, are no ambitious guest    
> Of sheriff’s dinner or mayor’s feast,
> Nor com'st to view the better cloth of state,    
> The richer hangings, or crown-plate,    
> Nor throng'st, when masquing is, to have a sight    
> Of the short bravery of the night,    
> To view the jewels, stuffs, the pains, the wit    
> There wasted, some not paid for yet;    
> But canst at home in thy securer rest    
> Live, with un-bought provision blessed,    
> Free from proud porches, or their gilded roofs,    
> ‘Mongst lowing herds and solid hoofs,    
> Alongst the curled woods and painted meads    
> Through which a serpent river leads     
> To some cool, courteous shade, which he calls his,     
> And makes sleep softer than it is!

Ben Jonson, from “To Sir Robert Wroth.”
