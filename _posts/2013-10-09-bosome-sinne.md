## SINNE. (I)

> LORD, with what care hast thou begirt us round !     
> > Parents first season us :  then schoolmasters     
> > Deliver us to laws ;  They send us bound     
> To rules of reason, holy messengers,     
>
> Pulpits and sundayes, sorrow dogging sinne,    
> > Afflictions sorted, anguish of all sizes,    
> > Fine nets and stratagems to catch us in, 
> Bibles laid open, millions of surprises,     
>
> Blessings beforehand, tyes of gratefulnesse,     
> > The sound of glorie ringing in our eares ;     
> > Without, our shame ;  within, our consciences ;     
> Angels and grace, eternall hopes and fears.     
>
> > Yet all these fences and their whole aray 
> > One cunning bosome-sinne blows quite away.
