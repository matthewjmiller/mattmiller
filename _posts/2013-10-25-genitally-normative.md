> The father of four has something in common with the childless man: people’s thoughts turn toward his genitals. When you have no children, they wonder if you are capable of having any; when you have four children, they wonder why you can’t, or won’t, keep it in your pants. Those with only one, two, or three children don’t have this problem. They are genitally normative.

[Mark Oppenheimer](https://medium.com/p/f3fab9d68338). Consider this, and then consider that my youngest brother (the sixth) was born when I was a teenager.
