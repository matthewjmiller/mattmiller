1. Talk to your toddler about your pending departure (and subsequent return) several minutes before you have to leave. Explain that you will return.

2. Make a clean break—don’t linger on the doorstep.

3. Employ industrial-grade distraction, such as a laundry basket full of wooden blocks, a two-liter bottle of Coca-Cola, or a flame thrower.
