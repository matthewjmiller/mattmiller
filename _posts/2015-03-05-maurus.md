> Maybe someone will not hesitate to call this book verbose.    
> Maybe someone much more excellent will think    
> that only few things have been found here, while he himself found more.    
> The slow and impatient will think that this is much too obscure:    
> Books have their fates according to what the reader can grasp.    
> But I do not regret my judgment: it is good that I committed this    
> to you, who have both love and wisdom,    
> and in whom is always firmly planted your usual industriousness.    
> You I will follow, when you have examined this, that’s caution enough.    
> While I wrote this, I was sick for two times five months    
> and was hanging as an ambiguous body in the judging scales,    
> swaying in alternate directions, but not sinking down through either weight.    
> For neither did Death avidly open its black gaping holes    
> nor did the Parcae hold on to my life with a strong thread.    
> In that way such a long time led to the present day,    
> renewing the different pains, and always threatening without end.    
> Yet, when I could, I crept up and finished what I had begun,    
> so that, uncertain of my life, even so people could see I had lived.
