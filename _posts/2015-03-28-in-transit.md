> Somewhere are places where we have really been, dear spaces<br />
> Of our deeds and faces, scenes we remember<br />
> As unchanging because there we changed, where shops have names,<br />
> Dogs bark in the dark at a strangerâ€™s footfall<br />
> And crops grow ripe and cattle fatten under the kind<br />
> Protection of a godling or godessling<br />
> Whose affection has been assigned them, to heed their needs and<br />
> Plead in heaven the special case of their place.

From W. H. Auden, "In Transit."
