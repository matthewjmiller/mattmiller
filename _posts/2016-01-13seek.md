Seek the LORD and live,    
lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph,    
and it devour, with none to quench it for Bethel,    
O you who turn justice to wormwood    
and cast down righteousness on the earth!    
He who made the Pleiades and Orion,    
and turns deep darkness into the morning    
and darkens day into night,    
who calls for the waters of the sea    
and pours them out on the surface of the earth,    
the LORD is his name;    
who makes destruction flash forth against the strong,    
so that destruction comes upon the fortress.

Amos 5:6-9 (ESV)
