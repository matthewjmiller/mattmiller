> It is good for man to eat thistles, and to remember that he is an ass. But the artichoke is the best of thistles, and the man who enjoys it has the satisfaction of feeling that he is an ass of taste.

*Kettnerâ€™s Book of the Table* (1877), qtd. by [William Woys Weaver](https://www.motherearthnews.com/organic-gardening/heirloom-artichoke-varieties-zewz1304zsch).
