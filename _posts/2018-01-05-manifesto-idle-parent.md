> **Manifesto of the idle parent**
>
> We reject the idea that parenting requires hard work
> We pledge to leave our children alone
> That should mean that they leave us alone, too
> We reject the rampant consumerism that invades children from the moment they are born
> We read them poetry and fantastic stories without morals
> We drink alcohol without guilt
> We reject the inner Puritan
> We fill the house with music and laughter
> We don't waste money on family days out and holidays
> We lie in bed for as long as possible
> We try not to interfere
> We push them into the garden and shut the door so that we can clean the house
> We both work as little as possible, particularly when the kids are small
> Time is more important than money
> Happy mess is better than miserable tidiness
> Down with school
> We fill the house with music and merriment
