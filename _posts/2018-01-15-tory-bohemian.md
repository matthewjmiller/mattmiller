> A Tory, according to Samuel Johnson, is a man attached to orthodoxy in church and state. A bohemian is a wandering and often impecunious man of letters or arts, indifferent to the demands of bourgeois fad and foible. Such a one has your servant been. Tory and bohemian go not ill together: it is quite possible to abide by the norms of civilized existence... and yet to set at defiance the soft securities and shame conventionalities of 20th-century sociability.

Russell Kirk. I think I got this via my friend Matthew Healey.
