Another fragment that I liked from my notes. In defense of a personal sensibility that some would term pessimism or negativity.

> To look at a world full of foolishness, suffering, and evil and proclaim it unambiguously good out of a desire to reject "negativity" is to accept the lie that all is as it should be. 
>
> To see the world as its oft-broken and pathetic self is to confront that lie and, by seeing it for the falsehood that it is, to refuse to be subdued.
