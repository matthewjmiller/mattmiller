> Two men had to cross a dangerous bridge. The first convinced himself that it wd. bear them, and called this conviction Faith. The second said 'Whether it breaks or holds, whether I die here or somewhere else, I am equally in God's good hands.' And the bridge did break and they were both killed: and the second man's Faith was not disappointed and the first man's was.

From a letter to Mrs. D. Jessup, March 1954, in *Collected Letters* vol. III.

This was Lewis's final word in response to Mrs. Jessup telling him (apparently amicably, but the reason isn't stated) that she needed to break off their correspondence of several years.
