Joe Pug’s song “The Great Despiser" is a narrative song, as evinced in his [oblique explanation of the title](http://www.pastemagazine.com/blogs/av/2012/02/joe-pug-song-premieralbum-announcement.html) to *Paste,* that “the great despiser is what the narrator refers to himself as."

Yet it’s also a song about certain emotional/spiritual battle: the strife between wonder and acedia in the human soul. In that sense, I too am the Great Despiser.
