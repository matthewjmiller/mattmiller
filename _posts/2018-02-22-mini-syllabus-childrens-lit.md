*My reading tends to cluster around themes and specific interests (like many people, I'm sure) even if I'm not formally studying or writing about them. Every now and then I will organize them into a brief bibliography like this: think of it as a mini-syllabus, or short edited collection drawn from a really great conference.*

A significant theme in many of the writers I value is the (beneficial) relationship between children’s literature and Literature literature. Without sentiment, these are readings that exposit the value of children's literature even for those of us who have left childhood behind.
