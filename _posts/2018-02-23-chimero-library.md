> I once heard that a library is one of the few remaining places that cares more about you than your wallet. It means that a person can be a *person* there: not a customer, not a user, not an economic agent, not a pair of eyes to monetize, but a citizen and community-member, a reader and a thinker, a mind and—God, I am going to say it—a *soul.*
