> On February 27th the Church of England keeps the feast and celebrates the memory of George Herbert, the gentle poet priest whose book the Temple, published posthumously in 1633 by his friend Nicholas Ferrar has done so much to help and inspire Christians ever since.

My favorite Herbert is "The Windows":

> Lord, how can man preach thy eternal word?     
> >   He is a brittle crazy glass;     
> Yet in thy temple thou dost him afford      
> >   This glorious and transcendent place,     
> >   To be a window, through thy grace.     
>
> But when thou dost anneal in glass thy story,     
> >   Making thy life to shine within     
> The holy preachers, then the light and glory      
> >   More reverend grows, and more doth win;     
> >   Which else shows waterish, bleak, and thin.     
>
> Doctrine and life, colors and light, in one     
> >   When they combine and mingle, bring     
> A strong regard and awe; but speech alone     
> >   Doth vanish like a flaring thing,     
> >   And in the ear, not conscience, ring.
