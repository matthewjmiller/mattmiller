> I was raised up believing    
> I was somehow unique    
> Like a snowflake distinct among snowflakes

> And now after some thinking    
> I'd say I'd rather be   
> A functioning cog in some great machinery    
> Serving something beyond me

> I don't believe in Armageddon    
> Heaven, hell, or time regretted    
> I'm gonna love you like we're all each other have    
> So take your idols and your fables    
> Trick your mind, so you'll be able    
> To deal with pain and death and loss of those you've loved
