A Happy Easter to my friends on the Western liturgical calendar: Christ is risen! Here are three poems I love for the day.

**Seven Stanzas at Easter**, by **John Updike**:

> Make no mistake: if He rose at all    
> it was as His body;    
> if the cells' dissolution did not reverse, the molecules    
> reknit, the amino acids rekindle,    
> the Church will fall.

**The Earthly Resurrection** and **The Heavenly Resurrection,** by **Aaron Belz**:

> Look at all the weird seedsâ€”   
>    plum stones and green beans,   
> salted sunflower snacks,    
>    buttered peas, silkweed pods    
> spilling downy-tufted spores,    
>    artichoke hearts, apple pips,   
> maple wings falling like helicopters    
>    up and down Main Street . . .
