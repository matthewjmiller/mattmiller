**Atlas**

There is a kind of love called maintenance    
Which stores the WD40 and knows when to use it;    
    
Which checks the insurance, and doesnâ€™t forget    
The milkman; which remembers to plant bulbs;    
    
Which answers letters; which knows the way    
The money goes; which deals with dentists    
   
And Road Fund Tax and meeting trains,    
And postcards to the lonely; which upholds    
    
The permanently rickety elaborate    
Structures of living, which is Atlas.    
    
And maintenance is the sensible side of love,    
Which knows what time and weather are doing    
To my brickwork; insulates my faulty wiring;    
Laughs at my dryrotten jokes; remembers    
My need for gloss and grouting; which keeps    
My suspect edifice upright in air,    
As Atlas did the sky.
