It may please those of you who read this blog's exceedingly infrequent, erratic, and oblique posts to know that I have taken a position as Assistant Professor of English at the College of the Ozarks in Point Lookout, Missouri. With my return to full-time academic employment, posting around here should eventually become more frequent, if no less erratic and oblique.

That is, in the long term. In the short term, I have a house to sell, a house to buy, a move to make, classes to prep, and not least—indeed, probably *most*—another baby to welcome into our family before the fall semester starts. 

So. I expect to post here much more frequently eventually. Not soon. Maybe in 6-9 months? Look out for that. 

In the meantime: pray for me.
