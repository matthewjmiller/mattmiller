> We have not got to where we are by anything so simple as deciding what we wanted to do and then doing itâ€”as if we had shopped in a display of lives and selected one. We have, instead, in the midst of living, and with time passing, been discovering how we want to live, and inventing the ways.

Wendell Berry, *A Continuous Harmony*
