"My whole life had been spent waiting for an epiphany, a manifestation of God's presence, the kind of transcendent, magical experience that lets you see your place in the big picture. And that is what I had with my first compost heap."

Bette Midler, quoted in the *Los Angeles Times,* May 8, 1996. As quoted in Charlotte Mendelson, *Rhapsody in Green.*
