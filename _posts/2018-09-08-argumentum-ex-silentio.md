> The fact that God hides himself in the midst of revealing himself is paradoxically a testimony to his reality. Presence-in-absence is the theme of his self-disclosure. God isn’t hidden because we are too stupid to find him, or too lazy, or not “spiritual” enough. He hides himself for his own reasons, and he reveals himself for his own reasons. If that were not so, God would not be God; God would be nothing more than a projection of our own religious ideas and wishes.

> The Lord hides himself from us because *he is God*, and God reveals himself to us because *God is love* (1 John 4:8). Does that make sense? Probably not—but sometimes Christians must be content with theological paradox. To know God in his Son Jesus Christ is to know that he is unconditionally love unto the last drop of God’s own blood. In the cross and resurrection of his Son, God has given us everything that we need to live with alongside the terrors of his seeming absence.

[Fleming Rutledge](https://www.christiancentury.org/article/critical-essay/divine-absence-and-light-inaccessible). In an absolutely piercing and beautiful essay, Rutlege here makes a rather novel *argumentum ex silentio* for God's existence: a God who did *not* hide himself, on this account, would not be God.
