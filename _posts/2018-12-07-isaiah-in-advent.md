One of my favorite musicians, John Hermanson, is in his third year of playing a nightly free concert throughout Advent. He plays the entirety of his album _Isaiah_, with texts drawn word-for-word from the biblical book. John's music can be odd and spiky in a way I find entirely appropriate to the liturgical season and the biblical prophet. [You can stream the concerts every night at 8pm CST here](https://www.concertwindow.com/johnhermanson).
