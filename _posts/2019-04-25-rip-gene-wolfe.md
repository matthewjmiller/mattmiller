Gene Wolfe is a writer like nobody else, and although I can't say that I'm an expert on his oeuvre, I have read more than a little of it. (*The Wizard Knight* is my favorite and a good place to start.) I have been reading some tributes and criticism in light of his recent death, of which the best pieces so far are [Brian Phillips's unsummarizable biographical treatment](https://www.theringer.com/2019/4/25/18515675/gene-wolfe-science-fiction-author) and [this wonderful long essay by Kim Stanley Robinson](https://www.nyrsf.com/2013/09/a-story-kim-stanley-robinson.html) which reveals a key piece of information about one of Wolfe's best-known novels. Spoilers, obviously, await.
