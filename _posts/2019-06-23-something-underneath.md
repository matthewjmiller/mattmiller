A mural in downtown Seward, Nebraska, in my home county. 

Art probably by Reinhard Marxhausen; text by [Bill Kloefkorn](https://journalstar.com/news/opinion/editorial/columnists/editorial-kloefkorn-s-words-live-on/article_67e01d1f-dd3c-5d70-85d8-964b67eb8f61.html).

I drove by this all my life growing up without thinking about it much. For some reason, I'm thinking about it now. Via connectseward.org
