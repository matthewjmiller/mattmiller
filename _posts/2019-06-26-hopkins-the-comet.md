          â€”I am like a slip of comet,    
Scarce worth discovery, in some corner seen    
Bridging the slender difference of two stars,    
Come out of space, or suddenly engender'd    
By heady elements, for no man knows:    
But when she sights the sun she grows and sizes    
And spins her skirts out, while her central star    
Shakes its cocooning mists; and so she comes    
To fields of light; millions of travelling rays    
Pierce her; she hangs upon the flame-cased sun,    
And sucks the light as full as Gideon's fleece:    
But then her tether calls her; she falls off,    
And as she dwindles shreds her smock of gold    
Amidst the sistering planets, till she comes    
To single Saturn, last and solitary;     
And then goes out into the cavernous dark.    
So I go out: my little sweet is done:    
I have drawn heat from this contagious sun:    
To not ungentle death now forth I run.

G.M. Hopkins

The astronomy's certainly out of date but I nonetheless get a lovely proto-sci-fi frisson from this poem.
