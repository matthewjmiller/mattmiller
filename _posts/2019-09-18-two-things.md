> An apocalyptic sense of dissolution and an overwhelming fear that the center cannot hold tend to make us believe that we must find some grand, heroic solution to set things to rights. And we may feel that we need to ignore anything that would distract us from the single-minded pursuit of this solution. Yet [Wendell] Berry's response to large-scale problems is the humble work of finding two things that belong together and putting them back together. Two things, not all things. He calls us to be a people who make things, who set to work fitting the broken pieces of our world back together.

Jeffrey Bilbro, from issue one of [*Local Culture,*](http://www.frontporchrepublic.com/local-culture/) a journal I commend highly to your attention.
