> Regenerative agriculture can be practiced by organic and non-organic farmers alike, rendering the approach accessible to all types of farmers regardless of their starting point. General Mills frames its understanding of regenerative agriculture around five key principles championed by scientists and pioneering farmers like Gabe Brown: minimize soil disturbance, maximize diversity, keep the soil covered, keep a living root in the ground year-round and integrate livestock.

I'm surprised and encouraged to see [a General Mills exec promoting regnerative agriculture](https://www.fooddive.com/news/how-regenerative-agriculture-and-organic-farming-helps-the-earth/565970/), and her definition of the essential practices are reasonably good if not complete, in my view.
