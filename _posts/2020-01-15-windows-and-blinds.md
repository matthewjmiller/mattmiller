Marking this completely unprompted bit of deductive reasoning from my 6YO down for posterity: 

> Daddy. It's true that some windows have blinds and need them, and other windows have blinds and don't need them. Other windows don't have blinds and *do* need them, and *other* windows don't have blinds and *don't* need them. Those are the four things I have to tell you about windows and blinds.
