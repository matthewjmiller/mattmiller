Deanna Dikeman took a photo of her elderly parents waving goodbye each time she left their house in Sioux City, Iowaâ€”at least once a year for 27 years. The collection carries the title "Leaving and Waving." The photos document a particular moment experienced by all of us who live far from home: the final (for that visit, at least) exit from the driveway, the departure that carries one into separation and distance again, a moment that has brought me to wrenching, painful tears more than once. Given the chronology of the series, of course, we also witness much more about the changes brought about by time. I would urge you to check out the series:
