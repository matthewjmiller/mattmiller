My newsletter, consisting of garden notes and an ongoing series of essays on permaculture and the liturgical year is [A Habitation](https://habitation.substack.com/). Other recent work: my essay on Nebraska's flooding, a mysterious concrete box, and canoeing unknown waterways can be read at [*Big Muddy*](https://bigmuddyjournal.com/2020/05/29/crossing-flatwater/); a consideration of how regenerative farming and permaculture could change the landscape of the Midwest is now up at [*The Cleveland Review of Books*](https://www.clereviewofbooks.com/home/2020/6/12/a-restored-miswestern-landscape-on-mark-shepards-restoration-agriculture).
