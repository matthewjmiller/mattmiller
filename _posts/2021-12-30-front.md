I teach writing at College of the Ozarks in Point Lookout, Missouri and write rhetorical scholarship and literary essays. Recent works include [an essay on Ted Kooser and gravel roads as de facto public square at *The New Territory*](https://newterritorymag.com/literary-landscapes/ted-kooser-seward-county-nebraska/); a flash essay on homesickness, COVID, and Ron Hansen's short story "Nebraska" at [*Critical Read*](https://criticalread.org/art-is-essential-october-2020/); a look at the past and future of the small-town novel in [*The University Bookman*](https://kirkcenter.org/reviews/can-whimsy-save-the-small-town-novel/); and a consideration of how regenerative farming and permaculture could change the landscape of the Midwest at [*The Cleveland Review of Books*](https://www.clereviewofbooks.com/home/2020/6/12/a-restored-miswestern-landscape-on-mark-shepards-restoration-agriculture).
