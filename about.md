I teach writing at College of the Ozarks in Point Lookout, Missouri and write essays about gardening, agriculture, faith, and the Midwest. I write [a newsletter with seasonal reports on my permaculture garden](habitation.substack.com/). Recently, I wrote about domestic exploration and the cultural place of [ravines in the rural Midwest](https://www.frontporchrepublic.com/2021/01/ravining/). Originally from Nebraska, I live outside Reeds Spring, Missouri, with [my wife](https://www.instagram.com/windfallarts/) and our children.

The site is run using [Jekyll on GitHub Pages](https://github.com/matthewjmiller/). Please don't assume from that any real technical acumen on my part.
