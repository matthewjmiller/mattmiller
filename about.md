I am a writer and teacher from the lower Midwest, trained in classical rhetoric and attuned to questions of place, ecology, faith, and persuasion. This site is my extended brain and ongoing reading log: a commonplace book, cabinet of curiosities, and reference point for the more formal writing I usually do elsewhere. You're welcome to read along.

I teach technical writing, composition, creative writing, and a bit of literature at College of the Ozarks in Point Lookout, Missouri. I worked in marketing before moving into academia, and I still take on select clients for projects in technical writing, market research, and digital content. My research and writing range across rhetorical theory, environmental humanities, and the literary essay, but increasingly I write literary essays about gardening, theology, and the Midwest. 

I live near Reeds Spring, Missouri, on a half acre that my family and I manage using principles of permaculture and regenerative gardening. I'm originally a Nebraskan, and still pine for the open fields of the Great Plains.

The site is run using [Jekyll on GitHub Pages](https://github.com/matthewjmiller/). Please don't assume from that any real technical acumen on my part.
