I was once described as "flat, but in a good way." I'm a Nebraskan, so I take that as a compliment.

I am a researcher, writer, and teacher trained in rhetoricâ€”the ancient discipline that studies persuasion and communication. My abiding interests tend to revolve around questions of liturgy, media, and place. I teach writing and literature at the College of the Ozarks in Point Lookout, Missouri.

This website is my blog-slash-commonplace book. I use it for writing on occasion, but mostly I just post excerpts from my reading, images, and other shiny objects. The site is run using [Jekyll on GitHub Pages](https://github.com/matthewjmiller/).

My CV and other academic work [is hosted at Academia.edu](https://cofo.academia.edu/MattMiller). You can find out what I'm reading at any given moment by following my public annotations at [Diigo](https://www.diigo.com/user/matthewjmiller). I welcome email correspondence on anything I post here or elsewhere.
