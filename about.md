I write essays that praise the mutilated world and teach writing at College of the Ozarks in Point Lookout, Missouri. My [newsletter contains seasonal reports from my permaculture garden](habitation.substack.com/). A Nebraska native, I live outside Reeds Spring, Missouri, with [my wife](https://www.instagram.com/windfallarts/) and our four children. 

The site is run using [Jekyll on GitHub Pages](https://github.com/matthewjmiller/). Please don't assume from that any real technical acumen on my part.
