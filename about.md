I am a writer, teacher, and permaculture practitioner from the lower Midwest. 

I live near Reeds Spring, Missouri, with my wife Rachel, [a potter and fiber artist](https://www.etsy.com/shop/windfallarts), and our kids. We are slowly reforesting our half-acre retrosuburban property with a regenerative food forest and garden. I'm originally a Nebraskan, and still pine for the open fields of the Great Plains.

I teach composition, creative and technical writing, and literature at College of the Ozarks. I write literary essays and also [take on select clients for technical and content writing projects](http://matt-miller.org/work/).

The site is run using [Jekyll on GitHub Pages](https://github.com/matthewjmiller/). Please don't assume from that any real technical acumen on my part.
