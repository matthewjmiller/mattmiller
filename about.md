I was once described as "flat, but in a good way." I'm a Nebraskan, so I take that as a compliment.

I am a researcher, writer, and teacher trained in rhetoricâ€”the ancient discipline that studies persuasion and communication. I teach technical writing, composition, creative writing, and a bit of literature at College of the Ozarks in Point Lookout, Missouri. My research and writing range across rhetorical theory, environmental humanities, and the literary essay. I worked in marketing before moving into academia, and I still take on select clients for projects in technical writing, market research, and digital content.

This website serves as my blog-slash-commonplace book. I use it for writing on occasion, but mostly I just post quotes, images, and other shiny objects. The site is run using [Jekyll on GitHub Pages](https://github.com/matthewjmiller/).
