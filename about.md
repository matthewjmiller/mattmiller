I teach writing at College of the Ozarks in Point Lookout, Missouri and write essays about gardening, agriculture, faith, and the Midwest. I write [a newsletter with seasonal reports on my permaculture garden](habitation.substack.com/). Originally from Nebraska, I live outside Reeds Spring, Missouri, with [my wife](https://www.instagram.com/windfallarts/) and our children, whom we [homeschool using a Charlotte Mason curriculum](https://charlottemasonozarks.info/).

The site is run using [Jekyll on GitHub Pages](https://github.com/matthewjmiller/). Please don't assume from that any real technical acumen on my part.
