I am a writer, teacher, and permaculture practitioner from the lower Midwest. 

This site is my extended brain and ongoing reading log: a commonplace book, cabinet of curiosities, and reference point for the more formal writing I do elsewhere. You're welcome to read along. I also write [an email newsletter about gardening and the liturgical year](https://habitation.substack.com).

I live near Reeds Spring, Missouri, with my wife Rachel, [a potter and fiber artist](https://www.etsy.com/shop/windfallarts), and our kids. We are slowly reforesting our half-acre retrosuburban property with a regenerative food forest and garden. I'm originally a Nebraskan, and still pine for the open fields of the Great Plains.

The site is run using [Jekyll on GitHub Pages](https://github.com/matthewjmiller/). Please don't assume from that any real technical acumen on my part.
